        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to
          reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors,
          font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass
          uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
          $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our
          variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when
          working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the
          site.

        <h2>Nesting</h2>
        <p>
          When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested
          and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the
          same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules
          will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain
          and is generally considered bad practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a
          site's navigation:
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the
          nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it
          more readable.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Partials</h2>
        <p>
          You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS
          that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to
          modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial
          is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name
          it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that
          the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated
          into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Import</h2>
        <p>
          CSS has an import option that lets you split your CSS into smaller,
          more maintainable portions. The only drawback is that each time you
          use @import in CSS it creates another HTTP request. Sass builds on top
          of the current CSS @import but instead of requiring an HTTP request,
          Sass will take the file that you want to import and combine it with
          the file you're importing into so you can serve a single CSS file to
          the web browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's say you have a couple of Sass files, _reset.scss and base.scss.
          We want to import _reset.scss into base.scss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice we're using @import 'reset'; in the base.scss file. When you
          import a file you don't need to include the file extension .scss. Sass
          is smart and will figure it out for you.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="extend-inheritance">
        <h2>Extend/Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets
          you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It
          helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a
          simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using
          another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder
          classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only
          prints when it is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat
          and clean.
        </p>

        <p>
          What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and
          .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere that
          %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, & .warning will
          too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where each of these
          classes will get the same CSS properties as %message-shared. This
          helps you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder
          classes in Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make
          sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your
          styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because
          %equal-heights is never extended.
        </p>

      <section id="mixin-sass-style">
        <h2>Operators</h2>
        <p>
          Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard
          math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. In our example we're going to
          do some simple math to calculate widths for an aside & article.
        </p>

        <p>
          We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in
          Sass let us do something like take pixel values and convert them to
          percentages without much hassle.
        </p>

        <p class="success">You installed SASS successfully!</p>
        <p class="error">You think pineapple belongs on a pizza!</p>
        <p class="warning">
          Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a
          violent psychopath who knows where you live
